*Note:* you'll need to create a jabber account somewhere so this will all work.  If you don't have your own domain name, using Gmail is always an option.  Once you've created your bot's account, you'll need to log in as your bot via a chat client and invite your primary account as a friend.

## Running the Bot

Run this bad boy like so:

````
node bot.js
````
